      <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Like a caffè latte, caffè mocha is based on espresso and hot milk but with added chocolate flavouring and sweetener, typically in the form of cocoa powder and sugar. Many varieties use chocolate syrup instead, and some may contain dark or milk chocolate.
Caffè mocha, in its most basic formulation, can also be referred to as hot chocolate with (e.g., a shot of) espresso added. Like cappuccino, caffè mochas typically contain the distinctive milk froth on top, although, as is common with hot chocolate, they are sometimes served with whipped cream instead. They are usually topped with a dusting of either cinnamon, sugar or cocoa powder, and marshmallows may also be added on top for flavor and decoration.">Know more</a>

      <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Italy, and is traditionally prepared with steamed milk foam (microfoam).
Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milks, and flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder.It is typically smaller in volume than a caffè latte, with a thicker layer of microfoam.
The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour of their habits,[5] and in this context referring to the colour of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed coffee[6] (today mostly espresso). The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso créma and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the drink.">Know more</a>

The hot water can be drawn directly from the same espresso machine that is used to brew the espresso, or from a separate water heater or kettle. Using the same heater is convenient, particularly at home, not needing a separate heater, and the water can in fact be drawn directly into the glass, either before (for a Long Black) or after (for an Americano) pulling the shot of espresso.">Know more</a>

      <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Caffe latte (or simply latte) is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk.
In northern Europe and Scandinavia, the term café au lait has traditionally been used for the combination of espresso and milk. In France, café latte is mostly known from the original Italian name of the drink (caffè latte or caffelatte); a combination of espresso and steamed milk equivalent to a latte is in French called grand crème and in German Milchkaffee or (in Austria) Wiener Melange.
Variants include the chocolate-flavored mocha or replacing the coffee with another drink base such as masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate, matcha, turmeric or rooibos; other types of milk, such as soy milk or almond milk, are also used.">Know more</a>
